Step 1: Shuffle deck
Step 2: User 1 places bet
Step 3: Dealer places down 2 cards
Step 4: Prompt(?) if user wants to flip another card
Step 5: Repeat Step 4 if user is not over 21
Step 6: If user's value = 21, end prompt
Step 7: Dealer's turn. Repeat steps 3-6.
Step 8: If dealer and user value is 21, dealer wins.
Step 9: Whoever is closer to a value of 21 wins.
Step 10: If dealer and user are same value, dealer wins (alert: House always wins.)
Step 11: If user wants to double their bet, they can.
Step 12:

use buttons not prompt
build interface

dealer should be computer
dealer must hit till 17

on tie user gets bet back

start with 1000 bucks
if hit 0, can't continue

var suits
var values

basic layout

separate hands for dealer/user

hit can only be used when it's player's turn
1. bank starts at 1000
1. bet can only be increased/decreased by 10
1. use for loop, querySelectorAll in the class, then remove child (for reset function)

player is a function that has hit, deal and stand buttons inside?


deal function tells user value of their cards.
after value is displayed, ask user if they want to hit or stand.
